## Current version: <!-- The version on which you are proposing an improvement -->

## Background and motivation

<!--
We welcome enhancement proposals!
This template will help us gather the information we need to discuss your proposal and possibile implementation.

First, please describe the purpose and value of the new functionality here:
  * what problem does it solve?
  * which type(s) of projects does it affect?
  * is it specific to some configuration or toolchain?

Please include as many code snippets, CI log fragments, screenshots, etc. you deem useful to illustrate your point.
For texts spanning more than a few lines, please create a gist here https://gist.github.com/ and provide a link to it.

Don't forget to use syntax highlighting for Markdown code blocks. For example:

```XML
<Project>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <IsNicelyColored Condition="'$(HasXMLAfterTheThreeBackticks)' == 'true'">true</IsNicelyColored>
  <PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

GitHub's syntax highlighting supports more languages that would be practical to list here.
Here's the complete list: https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml

## Proposed enhancement

<!--
Please describe the desired behavior, i.e. _what_ the SDK should do, not _how_ (that belongs to the next section).
For example: The name of the artifacts directory should be configurable.
-->

## Implementation proposals

<!--
If you have an idea (or more than one) about _how_ the desired behavior can be implemented, please explain it here.
Be as detailed as your knowledge of the SDK allows. If you don't know the SDK internals, but think that e.g. changing
a module, or adding a well-known property, can be the way to go, feel free to say so.
Any level of detail, from "I don't know" to specific code snippets, is fine.
-->

## Usage examples

<!--
Please provide example code and/or project snippets that highlight how the proposed enhancement will affect user projects.
-->

## Risks

<!--
Please mention any risks that to your knowledge the proposed enhancement might entail:
  * breaking changes
  * performance regressions
  * security issues
  * possible incompatibilities
  * added or changed dependencies
  * etc.
-->
