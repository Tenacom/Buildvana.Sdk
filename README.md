**Buildvana** _/bɪldˈvɑːnə/_

1. a transcendent state of the .NET programmer's mind, in which there is neither suffering, confusion, nor waste of time.

2. a collection of open-source methods and processes to help .NET programmers achieve Buildvana.

3. a collection of open-source projects supporting programmers that aim to reach Buildvana.

## At a glance

Buildvana SDK is an opinionated, best-practices-based, CI-friendly, VS-friendly, MSBuild-powered build system for .NET projects.

It is part of [the Buildvana project](https://github.com/Buildvana/), which also comprises ready-to-use template repositories that implement automated build, testing, and deployment for .NET projects.

**NOTE:** Buildvana SDK, just as the whole Buildvana project, is still a work in progress. All standard disclaimers apply. However, the SDK has already been used successfully for internal projects at [Tenacom](https://github.com/Tenacom/), before it even became a project of its own.

### Benefits

- Single source of truth for assembly versions
- Single source of truth for package licenses and copyright notices
- Helps you keep your project files clean and concise - even better than "plain" MSBuild SDKs
- More auto-generated assembly information (`ClsCompliant`, `COMVisible`)
- Custom auto-generated assembly information
- Automatic configuration of commonly-used code analyzers
- ...

### Supported project types

At the moment, Buildvana SDK is being used mainly by .NET Standard and .NET Core libraries written in C#.

It _should_ work for .NET Core console applications.

It _may_ work for ASP.NET Core websites.

It _will not_ work for .NET Framework applications or libraries.

It _will not_ work for non-SDK (legacy) projects.

It _may_ work for WindowsDesktop projects. These will definitely be supported soon.

As for language support: Buildvana SDK _will_ work with C# projects, _should_ work with Visual Basic projects and _may_ work with F# projects.

### Requirements

#### Git repository

Buildvana SDK assumes that your project is in a Git repository. Furthermore, if your project is packable (i.e. it is meant to be distributed as a NuGet package), Buildvana SDK assumes that it is hosted on a GitHub public repository, for the purposes of generating a symbol package with SourceLink support.

Support for other Git servers will be implemented if / when asked for. It should be trivial enough, as long as there is a suitable SourceLink support package available.

Private repositories may or may not work. Testers welcome.

#### Toolchain

Building via the following tools is supported:

- MSBuild v16.8 or newer (`msbuild`) under .NET Framework 4.7.2 or newer, .NET SDK 5.0 or newer, or any recent version of Mono
- Visual Studio 2019 v16.8 or newer (building from IDE)
- .NET SDK 5.0.100 or newer (`dotnet build`, `dotnet msbuild`, etc.)

Latest versions of Visual Studio for Mac _should_ work, but we need confirmation by someone with a Mac.
