## Overview

All errors defined by the Buildvana SDK have a `BVE` prefix, while warnings have a `BVW` prefix. All error and warning numbers start from 1000, so they have no leading zeros.

Each module, as well as the SDK itself, is assigned a contiguous range of 100 error and 100 warning numbers, as listed below.
