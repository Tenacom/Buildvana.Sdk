  <!--
    This target is defined in Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets,
    which is only imported in inner builds, so it is not available when packing.
    
    SourceLink defines it so it can work in outer builds,
    but we need it to exist regardless of SourceLink being present,
    because our target that sets .nuspec file properties depende on it
    (see NuspecFile.targets).
